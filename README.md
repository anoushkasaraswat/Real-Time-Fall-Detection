# Real-Time-Fall-Detection
The aim of this project is to correctly detect the fall of a person and inform his/her caretaker by sending the message. It is done with the help of a waistband to which all the equipment is fixed. For this, 2 tri-axial accelerometers- one on the STM32F4 discovery board and an external MPU-6050, Zig-Bee transmitter and receiver modules and a buzzer are used. The STM32F4 Discovery board follows the SPI protocol to communicate with the onboard accelerometer (LIS3DH) while the MPU-6050 follows the I2C communication protocol. The Zig-Bee communicates with the microprocessor via the UART protocol.
